# Matrix Rain Code in P5.JS

This is the p5.JS version of my previous Matrix project made in python.

The program displays Katakana characters falling down the screen same as the intro to the Matrix movie with some key differences here and there.

You can see a live demo here at https://asherand.github.io/Matrix-Rain-p5.JS/
